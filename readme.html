	<p>Our project is based on Nuclear inventory and test data taken from the website <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/nuclear-weapons/">Our World in Data</a>.</p>

	<p>For our project, we focus on displaying an interactive global map for all global nuclear tests. We show tests using the coordinates supplied and overlay red leaflet circles whose size are dependent on the test yield. For example, a test with a yield of 17,000 kilotons will have a larger circle than a test with a yield of 10,000 kilotons. </p>

	<p>In addition to the map, we also added bar graphs of each country that currently has a nuclear arsenal. We display the breakdown by each year, starting with 1945 directly after WWII to the present. On hover, the tooltip will show the number of nukes for a given year.</p>
